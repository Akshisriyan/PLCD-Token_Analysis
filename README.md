# PLCD (Programming Language and Compiler Design) - Token Analysis

This repository contains code for token analysis implemented using lexemes and Python libraries as part of the Programming Language and Compiler Design project.


## Introduction

Token analysis is a crucial step in compiler design where source code is broken down into meaningful tokens for further processing. This repository provides an implementation of token analysis using lexemes and Python libraries.

## Features

- Lexical analysis of source code files.
- Tokenization using Python libraries.
- Support for various programming languages.
- Easily extensible and customizable.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AkshiSriyan/PLCD-Token_Analysis.git
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your source code files in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the token analysis script:
    ```bash
    python TokenCode.py
    ```
